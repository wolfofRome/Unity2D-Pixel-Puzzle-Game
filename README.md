**Description:** 

- This is a pixel style 2D game based on Unity3D.
- The player can use the keyboard and mouse to control the movement of the characters and the funtion keys. The game perspective adopts the form of Top-Down. The player needs to constantly interact with the surrounding things to obtain "clues" or keys to solve various puzzles and mechanisms. Connect all "clues" together to get a complete story line.
- The game method of solving puzzles and fragmented "clues" will provide players with an immersive gaming experience, and the player will also get a great sense of accomplishment when the truth is finally obtained.
