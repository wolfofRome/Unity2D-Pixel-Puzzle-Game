**Concept Statement:** 

- Game type: This is a pixel game. The pixel style gets rid of people's social aesthetic fatigue. Compared with the reality that a large number of games are constantly pursuing, the simple and casual style will attract the needs of players more.

- It is also a puzzle-solving adventure game, which requires players to analyze and process the information and plots that appear in the game, and then find clues to solve various puzzles. Therefore, Players can look for the "truth behind" step by step during the game and get an immersive gaming experience.

- Game background: The background story of the game will not be displayed in text form at the beginning of the game, but will be interspersed in the whole game in clues combined with puzzles, which can better improve the player's gaming experience.
